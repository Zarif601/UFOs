# UFOs

## Overview of the Project

This project uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build a website which contains a dynamic table. The table has multiple filter options to filter it's data and retreive relevant information about UFO sightings in the United States.

### Purpose

Building a website with a dynamic table, that can be filtered using different categories is the main purpose of this project. The website is built using HTML elements and stylized with CSS. JavaScript files contain the data and displays it with the help of HTML on the webpage. The final product is a webpage containing a table of data regarding UFO sightings, which can be filtered by single or multiple criteria.

## Results

The webpage is a simple one with structured layout which contains different kinds of information. Starting from the top, there is a "UFO Sightings" button at the top left in the navigation bar. Pressing the button resets the filters and displays the raw table. Beneath that is the page header of the webpage: "The Truth Is Out There" with a background image. Underneath the backgroup image are two elements. On the left we have the title of a relevant article and on the right the article itself is displayed. Altogether the webpage looks as follows:

Below the article we have the dynamic table itself, powered by JavaScript. The filters for the table is located on the the left hand side of the table with multiple different text-boxes for user input. Simply pressing "Enter" or clicking on a different part of the page after typing something in the filter activates it. On the right hand side the table of UFO sightings data is displayed. Here is how the unfiltered table looks like:

As mentioned earlier, users can use one or multiple-criteria for the filters to find the information they seek. An example of a multiple-criteria filtration is displayed below:

## Summary

Although the webpage works well and looks nice, a drawback of the design is that the final webpage doesn't contain a button for the users to press. With the absence of a button, instructions may need to be provided to users so that they know how to use the filters.

Two recommendations for further development of the webpage are as follows:

1. When the raw sightings table is displayed, it displays all the content and becomes very long. Shortening the table and using a slider to slide through the table in the raw form could make the webpage look and feel better.
2. Adding links to other websites and information regarding UFOs can bolster the webpage even further and make it more informative.
